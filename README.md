# RothkoPainting
A Rothko-inspired painting using HTML and CSS (FreeCodeCamp)
-------------------------
Project Description:
This project aims to recreate a Rothko-inspired painting using HTML and CSS. A Rothko painting is characterized by large, rectangular blocks of color that blend together seamlessly, often creating a sense of depth and emotion.

-------------------------

How it Works:

-------------------------

HTML Structure:
The HTML structure consists of a main div container with a canvas class.
Inside the canvas, three div elements are used to represent the individual color blocks.

-------------------------

CSS Styling:
The canvas element is given a background color and a blur filter to create a soft effect.
Each color block (div) is assigned a specific color, size, and position.
Various CSS properties like box-shadow, border-radius, and transform are used to add depth and visual interest.

-------------------------

Usage:
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
The Rothko painting will be displayed on the page.

-------------------------

Customization:
To modify the colors, sizes, or positions of the color blocks, adjust the CSS properties within the .one, .two, and .three classes.
Experiment with different blur values, box shadows, and border radii to create unique variations.

-------------------------

Additional Notes:
This project is a basic implementation of a Rothko painting using HTML and CSS. For more advanced features or interactivity, consider using JavaScript.
You can explore different color palettes and design elements to create your own personalized Rothko-inspired artwork.

-------------------------

A Rothko painting typically features:
Large, rectangular shapes: These shapes are used to represent different color blocks.
Soft transitions between colors: The edges of the color blocks are often blurred or blended to create a smooth transition.
Minimalistic design: Rothko paintings often have a minimalist aesthetic, focusing on the interplay of colors and shapes.
